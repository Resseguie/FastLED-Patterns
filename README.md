A bunch of sample color patterns using FastLED library for controlling LED strips such as Adafruit Neopixels.

You'll need to have the FastLED library installed: http://fastled.io/

Depending on your specific LED strip, you'll need to be sure you power it appropriately. If you're using the Adafruit Neopixels like I am, they have a lot of information and best practices you'll want to read: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/best-practices

Here is my setup if it helps you get started.
